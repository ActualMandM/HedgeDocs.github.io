# Unused Time Eater Gauge
There's an unused gauge that was supposed to be used in the Time Eater boss battle. The gauge is present in `bb.cpk/SonicActionCommonHud/ui_gameplay.xncp`, in the `blb_gauge` XNCP scene. Unfortunately, this gauge isn't functional in-game, and its usage also remains unknown.

Visually, this element appears to be finished, and it even features animations.

## Intro_Anim
Following the naming scheme of almost every XNCP animation made for Generations, this was supposed to be played whenever the HUD element showed up on screen. Simple slide-in animation.

## change_c2g
According to the name, it was supposed to be played whenever switching from Classic to Modern Sonic, referred to as "Generic" in the game files.

## change_c2w
Not sure what the "w" stands for, but seems like this was supposed to be an animation when changing to an intermediate state between Classic and Modern Sonic.
